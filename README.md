This software is an independent software used for time management. The theory is based on the New Oriental teacher, Aili's "34 gold coin time management law". I am also deeply helped by this method. Now the work efficiency and time management ability have been greatly improved, so I want to make a related management software, in order to help more friends improve work efficiency.

At present, the function of this software is not perfect, and there may be some bug needs to be modified. If you find bug, you can send an email to me, or send a patch directly on GitHub.

In the next development, will join the past events change, pie chart statistics, and multi format data output function.

If you have any advice or advice, you can send me an email. My email address is wandy005@email518.com.
